Kustomize offers a way of generating ConfigMaps and Secrets as part of our customizations.


Create a file called `application.yaml` in `kustomize/base` and add the following content

```editor:append-lines-to-file
file: ~/demo/kustomize/base/application.yaml
text: |
      logging:
        level:
          org:
            springframework: INFO

```



*   We can now tell Kustomize to generate a ConfigMap from this file, in `kustomize/base/kustomization.yaml` by adding the following snippet to the end of the file


```editor:append-lines-to-file
file: ~/demo/kustomize/base/kustomization.yaml
text: |
      configMapGenerator:
        - name: k8s-demo-app-config
          files:
            - application.yaml

```



*   If you now run `$ kustomize build` you will see a ConfigMap resource is produced


```execute-1
kustomize build kustomize/base
```

```
apiVersion: v1
data:
  application.yaml: |-
    logging:
      level:
        org:
          springframework: INFO
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: k8s-demo-app-config-fcc4c2fmcd
```


By default `kustomize` generates a random name suffix for the ConfigMap.  Kustomize will take care of reconciling this when the `ConfigMap` is referenced in other places (ie in volumes). It does this to force a change to the `Deployment` and in turn force the app to be restarted by Kubernetes. This isnâ€™t always what you want, for instance if the `ConfigMap` and the `Deployment` are not in the same `Kustomization`. If you want to omit the random suffix, you can set `behavior=merge` (or `replace`) in the `configMapGenerator`.



Now edit `deployment.yaml` in `kustomize/base` to have Kubernetes create a volume for the ConfigMap and mount that volume in the container

Create the volume.
```editor:insert-value-into-yaml
file: ~/demo/kustomize/base/deployment.yaml
path: spec.template.spec
value:
      volumes:
        - name: config-volume
          configMap:
            name: k8s-demo-app-config

```

Mount the volume.
```editor:insert-value-into-yaml
file: ~/demo/kustomize/base/deployment.yaml
path: spec.template.spec.containers.[0]
value:
      volumeMounts:
        - name: config-volume
          mountPath: /workspace/config
```

*   In the above `deployment.yaml` we are creating a volume named `config-volume` from the ConfigMap named `k8s-demo-app-config`
*   In the container we are mounting the volume named `config-volume` within the container at the path `/workspace/config`
*   Spring Boot automatically looks in `./config` for application configuration and if present will use it (because the app is running in `/workspace`)
